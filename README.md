# Lunar-Terrain-Analysis-with-Image-Segmentation

Welcome to the Lunar Terrain Analysis project! This repository houses the code and resources for developing an advanced computer vision system tailored to precisely identify and segment rocks on the lunar surface.




**Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the lunar terrain by implementing advanced machine learning models and integrating libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, and more. The focus is on precise image processing in lunar imagery, discerning key features, and improving rock detection accuracy.

**Key Features**

Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), U-net architecture, and transfer learning.
Efficient image segmentation of lunar surface photographs.
Robust and reliable outcomes for rock detection.

**Usage**

Download the Artificial Lunar Rocky Landscape Dataset on Kaggle.
Set the img_dir and mask_dir paths in the notebook to the dataset's image and mask directories.
Run the provided code in a Jupyter environment.

**Two Key Achievements**

Developed a U-Net model for lunar landscape segmentation, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning for image analysis.
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of hyperparameters, achieving optimal performance with a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.80.
