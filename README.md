# Lunar-Terrain-Analysis-with-Image-Segmentation

Welcome to the Lunar Terrain Analysis project! This repository houses the code and resources for developing an advanced computer vision system tailored to precisely identify and segment rocks on the lunar surface.

**Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the lunar terrain by implementing advanced machine learning models and integrating libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, and more. The focus is on precise image processing in lunar imagery, discerning key features, and improving rock detection accuracy.

**Key Features**
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), U-net architecture, and transfer learning.
Efficient image segmentation of lunar surface photographs.
Robust and reliable outcomes for rock detection.
